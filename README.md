# spotify-jammming-app

This is a React web application I made with Codecademy.

The goal of this project was to focus on creating React components,
passing state, and Requests to the Spotify API to allow users to 
search Spotify and add create their own custom playlist. The 
html structure and css styling was provided by Codecademy. 

A live version of this app can be seen [here](https://we_be_jammming.surge.sh/)

You will be prompted to log into Spotify in order to access credentials 
to save tracks to a playlist in your Spotify account.

Hope you enjoy!
